# Outline
This project asked us to  create two Jupyter Notebooks; one for five tasks in line with weekly lectures and the other for the course project containing weekly tasks.

## General Info
This repository is created to complete the learning objectives for the Machine Learning and Statisitcs module as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in Computing.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named "tasks" for problems covering weekly topics and a separate Jupyter notebook that contains the overall course project. 

## Technologies
To run the noteboook on your local machine you will need Pyhton 3.9 or above. This notebook has been completed using Anaconda and the following imported the following libraries;

'''
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for plotting
- import sys
- import seaborn as sns
- from sklearn import datasets
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.svm import SVC
- from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
- from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
- from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
- from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
- from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
- from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC
- from sklearn.exceptions import FitFailedWarning
- import warnings

'''

## Setup
To run this notebook on a local machine you should do the following:
1. Open the command line on your machine. I use terminal in Visual Studio code but also recommend CMDer if working on a Windows device.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded notebook
3. In the terminal type "Jupyter Notebook" and press "Enter"
4. This will open the notebook on the Jupyter browser

The Python code is stored within the relevantJupyter Notebooks and can be run on any terminal. For this project I used visual studio code for ease of pushing to GitHub.
